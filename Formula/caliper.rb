  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Caliper was built on this machine, so it launches without a Gatekeeper prompt.

      Open it with:
        open #{prefix}/Caliper.app

      Run this once so upgrades keep the permission you grant:
        #{prefix}/scripts/signing-identity.sh

      The ruler, marquee and guides need no permissions. The loupe, eyedropper
      and edge snapping need Screen Recording, which Caliper asks for only when
      you first use one of them.
